Engineered a SystemVerilog floating-point multiply-accumulate module for matrix multiplication, leveraging DesignWare components and custom SRAM interface logic. 

Orchestrated robust DUT-testbench synchronization through implementation of a handshaking mechanism with valid/ready signals.
 
Validated design functionality via Cadence Xcelium simulation and optimized logic synthesis using Synopsys Design 

Vision, addressing potential issues such as latches and combinational loops.
